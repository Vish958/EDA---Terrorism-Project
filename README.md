# EDA---Terrorism-Project

# As a research analyst, I found the hot zones of terrorism and find which area is more affected during the terrorist attack. I also find the security issues and insights where work can be done accordingly.

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on "Terrorism"

● As a Security Defence Analyst, try to find out the Hot Zones of Terrorism

● What all security issues and insight you can derive by Exploratory Data Analysis

● I choosed the Python programming language and Jupyter Notebook tool for analyzing the data.

# EDA---Terrorism-Project

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on "Terrorism"

● As a Security Defence Analyst, try to find out the Hot Zones of Terrorism

● What all security issues and insight you can derive by Exploratory Data Analysis

● I choosed the Python programming language and Jupyter Notebook tool for analyzing the data.
